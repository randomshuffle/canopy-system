# Bolt-max prover timings

Input 2^22, width 16, 256-bit field, BLAKE3-256 commitments. 2 warmups, 10 measured repetitions, 8 Rayon threads. Every proof verified.

Canopy RS block lengths: systematic k/4 and parity k/4; total k/2, 40% of Bolt's encoded rows. Heights start at 3 for systematic and 1 for parity.

CPU-only, same encoder/hash code in both schemes. Public H setup and random input generation excluded. Commitment includes encoding. Opening includes g, projection, constrained WHIR proofs, row openings, and Canopy SEP proofs. Verification evaluates public H directly; no sparse-PCS preprocessing claim is made. The 128-bit per-event target is conditional on prime-field LDPC distance 0.013.
